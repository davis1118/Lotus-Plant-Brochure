            <h1>Alocasia Black Velvet</h1>
<p>
    The alocasia black velvet is a plant native to Southeast Asia, with this plant most likely originating from the jungles of Borneo.
    Its botanical name <em> Alocasia reginula </em> translates to “little queen.” Just like other alocasias, this plant grows from 
    rhyzomes and have a compact growth habit. It is classified as one of the ‘jewel Alocasias’ and is a part of the Aroid family
</p>

<p>
    With the right conditions, the plant can grow up to one to two feet in height while staying mostly compact and low to the ground. 
    New growth can cause older leaves to yellow, brown, and die off. This is completely normal and does not harm the overall health of 
    the plant. If proper conditions are met, the plant may even produce a white flower indoors.
</p>

<p>
    In the wild, the leaves can amazingly span nearly 2 feet wide.

    it can tolerate lower light levels. Avoid direct sunlight as it may cause the leaves to burn.<br><br>
    
    <em>Water</em><br>
    
    This plant should be watered once the top 1/2 inch of the soil has dried. This plant enjoys higher humidity levels of around 60%.<br><br>
    
    <em>Soil</em><br>
    Alocasia soil should be well aerated and drain well. A mixture of potting mix, perlite, and peat should be enough to keep 
    your plant happy and healthy.
