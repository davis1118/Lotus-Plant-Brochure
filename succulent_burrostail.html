            <h1>Burrotail</h1>
            <p>
              Often confused with being a cactus, the Burrotail is very much so a succulent. this plant is native to southern Mexico and gets its name from a reference to to donkey's tail.           </p> 
           <br> <!--New line-->
           <p>
            The Burrotail is a sustainable plant, capable of enduring heat as well as droughts rather well. this allows the plant to survive areas that hotter than usual.
           </p>
           <br><!--New line-->
           <p>
            The appearance of the Burro tail is mainly green, however it is common to see variations of this such as blue-green as well as gray-green. 
            This succulent is rather unique as instead of the average looking succulent the Burrotail looks as if it is a rope grown from plants. to play on top of this, it can be showcased in a hanging pot 
            to give your room a nice collection of natural hanging vine like effect.

                As for watering, ensure that the soil is dry then water once a month. <br><br>

                Please keep this succulent within a container that provides ample drainage.
