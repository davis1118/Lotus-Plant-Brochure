            <h1>Blue Torch Cactus</h1>
<p>
    The blue torch cactus is a plant that belongs in the Pilosocereus family which is native to Mexico, Brazil, and the Carribean. 
    The scientific name for this plant would be Pilosocereus Azureus. Blue torch cactus has a bright blue trunk with yellowish spikes
    covering the entire trunk. Favorite for landscapers and hobbyists that wants to find plants that contrast with their
    current collection or wants a unique statement cactus.

<p>
    Locally this plant is known as Tree Cactus because it is able to reach incredible heights. This cactus can grow up to 10 to 30-feet tall, 
    if grown in the right conditions. Expect your plant to be shorter than this if you are growing in a pot rather than in the ground. Blue torch
    cactus will show brighter blue color as it matures. As a young plant, you would likely see a more green trunk but that will change over time. 
</p>

<p>
    A mature Pilosocerus Azureus might bare you a gift between the months of April to July. The cactus will bloom white flowers with yellow insides. 
    You can increase the chances of these blooms by providing the best growing conditions you can for the plant as possible.

    <br><b>How to care for your new Blue Torch Cactus</b><br><br>
    
    <em>Light</em><br>
    Since this plant is a cactus it will require ample of sunlight. This would mean full sun with no shade. Cactus can withstand harsh sunlight
    and would thrive in this type of lighting. <br><br>
    
    <em>Water</em><br>
    Blue torch cactus is not as sensitive to humidity as other cacti. Regular watering during hot weather (slightly more than other cactus). Make
    sure the soil is completely dry in between waterings. Slow down the pace of watering during cooler months, when the plant is dormant. <br><br>

    <em>Soil</em><br>
    Loose, well draining soil would do this plant good. Cactus or succulent would work very well with this plant.<br>
